![Hex Board Game](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/38/Hex-board-11x11-%282%29.jpg)

Your objective is to implement in C# .Net a fully functional Hex Game that allows two different players to play the game, save the results and tells if a player has won.
The board size has to be configurable.

The game has a graphical interface that allows to see the players stones, select a stone and move it. If the move is possible, then the player can move it.

If this objective is met, it is possible to add a player against computer implementation. The computer game play can be done using Min-Max or Alpha-Beta alogorithms

# Game rules :

Each player is assigned a pair of opposite sides of the board which they must try to connect by taking turns placing a stone of their color onto any empty space. 

Once placed, the stones are unable to be moved or removed. A player wins when they successfully connect their sides together through a chain of adjacent stones. 

Draws are impossible in Hex due to the topology of the game board. 

# Development Rules :

The project has to be implemented in C# .Net following TDD rules. 

Both tests and concrete implementation will be taken into account for the final notes. Methods and Classes have to follow best practice rules and be easy to understand and meaningful.

The framework used for the graphical interface is free. You can use WPF, Winform or web interface or any graphical interface technology within C#.net Framework.

The project has to be in .Net Core 5.

# Project follow up :

Every team has to create a specific github branch named beta-project-gn where n is the group number (beta-project-g1, Beta-project-g2 etc)
Commits have to be done on a regular base and be done by all group participants.
